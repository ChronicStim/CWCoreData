CWCoreData
==========

Contains convinience additions to classes in CoreData in order to lazily create
a managed object model, persistent store cordinator, and thread local managed
object contexts when requested.

Also have additions to NSInvocation to support calling with NSManagedObject
instances over thread boundries.

This project is created with the intent to be used as a sub-project for other
Xcode project. Additionaly this project can be used as a git sub module.

This project has a dependency to CWFoundation. This dependency in added as
a git sub module in Components/CWFoundation. You may need to update this
dependency using:
    git submodule update --init --recursive

CWCoreData is weakly linked agains CWFoundation in order to avoid duplicate 
symbols if CWCoreData is used with other project that also have dependencies to 
CWFoundation. The result of this is that any project that links against 
CWCoreData must also link against CWFoundation explicitly.

You add this project as a sub project in Xcode like this:
1. Add this project as a sub project to your project.
2. Make sure this project product (libCWCoreData.a) is a target member.
3. Make sure the subprojects product (libCWFoundation.a) is a target member.
4. Add the CWCoreData target as direct dependency.
5. Add <Path To CWCoreData>/** to user header search paths.
6. Add -all_load to other linker flags.


Functionality
=============

The public headerfiles are the official source of documentation. This section
only describes a subset of the main funcationality.

* Lazy creation of shared NSManagedObjectModel and NSPersistenceStoreCordinator.
* Lazy creation of thread local NSManagedObjectContext instances.
  - Saves propages to all contexts.
  - Contexts are properly removed when threads exits.
* Convinience methods for fetching and creating NSManagedObjects.
* Convinience methods for transfering NSManagedObjects across thread contexts.
